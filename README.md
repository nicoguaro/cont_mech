Continuum Mechanics in Maxima Computer Algebra System
=======================================================

`cont_mech` is a [Maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) package intended to aid with operative issues in 
Continuum Mechanics lecturing and research. I wrote this package when
I was lecturing the undergrad  course *Mec√°nica de los Medios Continuos* 
(Introduction to Continuum Mechanics) for Civil Engineering at [Universidad EAFIT](http://www.eafit.edu.co/programas-academicos/pregrados/ingenieria-civil).

The package was mainly created for two reasons:

1. Help a student with reduced mobility to solve exercises in the computer
   (he could use it). So, it also helped me with the evaluation:
   making tests that can be solved in a computer.
2. Make some tedious calculations like vector identities, or apply differential
   operators in elasticity.
